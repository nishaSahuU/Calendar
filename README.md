<h3>About the Web App</h3>
<p>
I have created this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of different sources. This is an Task schedule Calendar, where user can add the task they wanted to do later or any reminder. The to-do task will be added to a table where user can edit or delete the task. There is also the option of filter where user can see the to-do list by 'sort by date' button which will sort the table date-wise or unfinished task, where unfinished task will be labeled first.
